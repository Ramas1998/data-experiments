This repo houses EDA, small data science projects and other experiments

Projects Contained in this repo are:

### Fact checking sites dashboard 
The [themes viz generator](https://github.com/tattle-made/data-experiments/blob/master/themes_viz_generator.ipynb) file is used to generate the files needed for the fact checking sites dashboards.
After generating the files, the files need to be pushed to the website. Please see: instructions on [Push to Website](https://github.com/tattle-made/web-apps/blob/master/packages/service-ui/README.md) to make the dashboard visible on [the khoj page](https://services.tattle.co.in/khoj/dashboard/)

### Bigram Clustering of Headlines of Fact Checking Articles
The [Bigram Clustering](https://github.com/tattle-made/data-experiments/blob/master/bigram-clustering.ipynb) file can be used to generate bigrams of headlines of articles. The bigrams can be used to identify similar or identical stories by different groups.

### Covid-19 Groups WhatsApp Data Analysis
The [whatsapp_groups_analysis](https://github.com/tattle-made/data-experiments/tree/master/whatsapp_groups_analysis) folder contains the code used to analyze conversations in WhatsApp groups Tattle tracked during the second Covid-19 wave in India. See the 'Crowdsourcing Aid' report here: https://tattle.co.in/articles/covid-whatsapp-public-groups/
